# pong-pixi-naive

This was my first warm-up attempt at building pong. I used this project to learn how to build pong. There are several issues with physics, AI and presentation that I did not want to solve because I didn't see the point -- so this was abandoned halfway.

The game still works, though. Just not the way you'd expect.
